SoftUni Parking

Your task is to create a repository, which stores cars by creating the classes described below.
First, write a C# class Car with the following properties:
•	Make: string
•	Model: string
•	HorsePower: int
•	RegistrationNumber: string

The class' constructor should receive make, model, horsePower, and registrationNumber and override 
the ToString() method in the following format:
"Make: {make}"
"Model: {model}"
"HorsePower: {horse power}"
"RegistrationNumber: {registration number}"
Create a C# class Parking that has Cars (a collection that stores the entity Car). 

The class' constructor should initialize the Cars with a new instance of the collection and accept capacity as a parameter. 
Implement the following fields:
•	Field cars –  a collection that holds added cars.
•	Field capacity – accessed only by the base class (responsible for the parking capacity).
Implement the following methods:

AddCar(Car Car)
The method first checks if there is already a car with the provided car registration number and if there is, 
the method returns the following message:
"Car with that registration number, already exists!"
Next check if the count of the cars in the parking is more than the capacity and if it returns the following message:
"Parking is full!"
Finally, if nothing from the previous conditions is true it just adds the current car to the cars in the parking and returns the message:
"Successfully added new car {Make} {RegistrationNumber}"

RemoveCar(string RegistrationNumber)
Removes a car with the given registration number. If the provided registration number does not exist returns the message: 
"Car with that registration number, doesn't exist!"
Otherwise, removes the car and returns the message:
"Successfully removed {registrationNumber}"

GetCar(string RegistrationNumber)
Returns the Car with the provided registration number.

RemoveSetOfRegistrationNumber(List<string> RegistrationNumbers)
A void method, which removes all cars that have the provided registration numbers. 
Each car is removed only if the registration number exists.
And the following property:
•	Count - Returns the number of stored cars.
